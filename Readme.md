## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a community-driven repository of high-quality educational resources. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, immutability, and accessibility for all users globally.

## Key Features
1. **Add Resources**: Contributors can add educational resources with details such as title, description, URL, and category.
2. **Retrieve Resources**: Users can fetch the list of all resources or a specific resource by its unique ID.
3. **Event Emission**: The contract emits an event whenever a new resource is added, ensuring traceability and easy integration with external applications.
4. **Decentralized Storage**: Resources are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and availability.
5. **Contributor Identification**: Each resource is tagged with the contributor's address for accountability.


## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IPFS for storing large resource files.
- Adding a voting mechanism to rate resources.
- Multi-language support for global accessibility.
